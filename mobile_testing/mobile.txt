Mobile Application Types. 
○ Native mobile application   
○ Mobile WEB application  
○ Hybrid mobile app   (examples: Twitter, Yelp, Netflix)                     

What is the difference between a native and a Mobile Web app?
A native mobile app is specifically designed and implemented to run on a device’s 
operating system and machine firmware, and typically needs to be adapted for different devices.
­ xCode­ Objective­C based integrated development environment (IDE) for OS x and 
­ Android Studio ­ Java based integrated development environment (IDE) for Android platform
­ Visual Studio/C# for Windows Phone. 
That means you must rewrite application for each of the device[mobile platform].
Example of native apps are, 
- games app.
- calender
- Messenger (SMS)
- Photo Gallery
- Email Apps

A Mobile Web app, or browser application, 
- every time u run the app, the contents are downloaded from Web.
- requires internet connection all the time.
- built using cross platform web technologies(HTML5, CSS, Javascript) 
- it can usually be accessed from all Web­capable mobile devices.
- Runs on common Browsers (Greater compatibility)
- Server side app (requires constant connection)
- Low development cost, less support
Examples: Restaurants, Retails and Shopping, News and Communications, Weather Publishers 

Hybrid Apps:
- It is developed using both native code(above point) and cross platform technologies.
- Business logic is implemented using cross platform web technologies(HTML5, CSS, Javascript).
- For each mobile platform, a different host is written using platform code
   xCode­ Objective­C based integrated development environment (IDE) for OS x and 
   Android Studio ­ Java based integrated development environment (IDE) for Android platform
   Visual Studio/C# for Windows Phone. 
- Hybrid apps are distributed in the app store.
Examples,
- twitter
- yelp
- netflix
- kindle

Techinuques of testing Mobile Application
- Manual Testing
- Testing using Emulators/Simulators
- Performance Testing (Automated Testing)

General Testing type:
- User Interface Testing: Color scheme, Menu styles, Consistency of UI over various Devices
- Usability Testing
- Functional Testing: Core functionality
- Performance & Stress Testing: Behavior of Mobile Application in Low resources (Memory/Space/Battery), Behavior of mobile website when many mobile user simultaneously access mobile website
- Security Testing: authentication and authorization, data security, allocation of data in offline mode, protection of the file system, options, hardware, network resources, etc.
- Compatibility: To make sure your application is not hampering native device functionality
Mobile Specific Testing:
nterruption Testing:
- Voice Calls, SMS, Charger, Low memory Notification while application is running.
- Soak Testing (Random Event Generator) :
  Continual key pad entries via tools to test application stability with various key press events.
- Low Network/No Network case Testing:
- Application behavior when there is no network coverage or   Low network strength.

Native Vs Mobile Web App Testing
1. Native App Preinstalled or Downloaded
     - Device Compatibility
     - Device and Software Integration
     - Data Processing and Integration
	 - Emulator-based testing          
2. Mobile Web App:
     - Browser Compatibility
     - HTML5 support
     - JS standards   

Emulators
An emulator is a software replica of an actual mobile device (or a software compatible with non-native environment ). 
	The emulator simulates the mobile device and lets you develop and test Android applications without using a physical device. 
	Emulators Types:
Device emulators
	BlueStacks – BlueStacks App Player lets you run mobile apps fast and full screen on Windows and Mac
	 Genymotion is a fast, easy to use and powerful Android emulator 
	Android SDK includes a mobile device emulator — a virtual mobile device (AVD) that runs on your PC
Browser emulator
     Mobile browser emulator https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mobile-browser-emulator/lbofcampnkjmiomohpbaihdcbjhbfepf?hl=en
Advantages:
- cost-effective because most of them are freeware.
- can maintain the original look, feel, and behavior of the physical device
- provide screenshots, high-level information, and data messages. 
- reduce development and testing efforts and miscommunication 
- content compatibility tests – such as verifying image sizes or identifying broken links – can be accurately and quickly performed. 


Mobile Project (Common Tasks)
a. Testing environments and app versions(modes):
(Hardware, OS, Networking, DB, Mail and WEB Servers) and application mode:
● Production Env   – Live (Beta)/Production release  
	– Open for users/public and Testers!!!!!;
	– Release Candidate/Pre­Production release/build 
	– Open for Testers before general release.
● QA/Staging Env          
	– QA build / Pre­Production/Alfa/       
	– Open for testers
● Development Env 
	– Dev build
	
b. Bug Tracking System
	Bugzilla:
	URL:         http://bugzilla.portnov.com
	User ID:     event­jan­6@school.com   
	PW:          event­jan­6
	
c. BUG REPORT STRUCTURE 
	­ Bugzilla Component based format:
		=> Log File attachment
		=> Android OS ­ alogcat App from Play Store
		=> iOS 9  (crash log and console log files) 
			1. From device ­ crash log only
			1) Open Settings app
			2) Go to Privacy, then Diagnostics & Usage
			3) Select Diagnostics & Usage Data
			4) Locate the log for the crashed app. The logs will be named in the format: <AppName>_<DateTime>_<DeviceName>
			5) Select the desired log. Then, using the text selection UI select the entire text of the log. Once the text is selected, tap Copy
			6) Paste the copied text to Mail and send to an email address as desired
