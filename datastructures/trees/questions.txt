1. Write a program to determine height of binary tree?
Ans:
Height of the tree
 The maximum height of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the path from the root node to the deepest leaf node. 
 Note that the maximum height of an empty tree is 0.
This is equivalent to Max Depth of the tree.
Solutions:
=> Recursive approach
=> Iterative approach

Recursive approach
 Basic recursive post order traversal will easily determine the height.

 int GetHeight(Node tree){
 	if (tree == null) return 0;
	int leftHeight = GetHeight(tree.left);
	int rightHeight = GetHeight(tree.right);
	return Max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
 }
 
 Time Complexity => We have to visit each Node only once.
 		 => O(n), n is number of nodes in the tree.

Iterative approach
 Methods=>
 a. Inorder traversal: Easy to implement
 b: Preorder traversal : Easy to implement
 c: Postorder: Effecient for this problem, since at any given node we know we have already traverse left and right subtree.
