Tag: 
Ans: Oracle 11g

2. What is RDBMS?
Tag: Basic
Ans: RDBMS stands for Relation Database Management System.
Oracle Sql Server and Microsoft SQL Server are type of RDBMS.
=> invented by IBM (E.F Codd)
=> it is a software program which manages relational database.
=> sql is used to access the database.
=> what is relational database
=> it is a collection of data items organized as a set of tables.
=> each table describes what type of data(using multiple columns) and the data itself(represented as row).
=> In a table, a row is refered to as RECORD and a Column is refered as FIELD

3. What is table?
Tag: Basic
Ans: Any data or information is stored as a table in RDBMS. A table has a unique name. Table is comprised of columns and rows.
     Columns contains column name, data type and any other attributes(Primary or Foriegn Key) of column.
     Rows contains the record or data for the column. A table can have 0 or more rows.
     Example:
     CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(ID INT NOT NULL, NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, AGE INT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(ID));

     INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS(1, "Mithila", 30);
     INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS(2, "Ajit", 33);

7. Why there is need of PRIMARY key?
Ans:

8. What is need for JOIN?
Ans:

9. What are different types of JOIN?
Ans:

10. What are VIEWS?
Ans:

11. Given are below two tables,
create table test_a(id numeric);
create table test_b(id numeric);

insert into test_a(id) values
				(10),
				(20),
      				(30),
        			(40),
	  			(50);
insert into test_b(id) values
	    			(10),
	      			(30),
	        		(50);
Write a query to fetch values in table test_a that are and not in test_b without using the NOT keyword.
Tag: Query
Ans:

12.
Write a SQL query to find the 10th highest employee salary from an Employee table. Explain your answer.

(Note: You may assume that there are at least 10 records in the Employee table.)
Tag: DISTINCT, TOP, ORDER BY, DESC
Ans:

SELECT DISTINCT TOP(10) Salary FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY Salary Desc
=> The above query will Salary of top 10 employee arange in descending order
=> But we need the 10th highest salary
Final Ans:
SELECT DISTINCT TOP(1)
( SELECT DISTINT TOP(10) Salary FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY Salary DESC )
Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary;

The above query will return the 10th highest salaried employee salary.


13. What is difference between WHERE and HAVING clause?
Ans:
When GROUP BY is not used, the WHERE and HAVING clauses are essentially equivalent.

However, when GROUP BY is used:

The WHERE clause is used to filter records from a result. The filtering occurs before any groupings are made.
The HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group (i.e., to check conditions after aggregation into groups has been performed).


14. What is key difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?
Ans:
Truncate is used to delete table content and the action can not be rolled back, whereas Delete is used to delete one or more rows in the table and can be rolled back.


15. Given a table dbo.users where the column user_id is a unique identifier, how can you efficiently select the first 100 odd user_id values from the table?
    (Assume the table contains well over 100 records with odd user_id values.)
Ans:
SELECT TOP 100 user_id FROM dbo.users WHERE user_id % 2 = 1 ORDER BY user_id
